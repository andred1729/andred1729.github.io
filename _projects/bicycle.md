Not a particularly technical project, but one I’m proud of.

I was moving out of the dorms into my apartment and had begun looking for a bike to make the longer commute easier. My choices were: spend \$200 + on a new bike or take my chances coordinating/finding a good deal on Facebook Marketplace for a used one. I didn’t like either option.

I was talking with my friend who’s very into biking, and he mentioned that in his dorm the obviously abandoned bikes had tags on them (the university management was trying to clean out the bike rooms) saying they would be removed by the end of the month.

I kept this in mind.

A few weeks later, I claimed one of those abandoned bikes.

It was in terrible condition: tape all over the chassis, the chain completely rusted, the back wheel unusable/burst, and the rear brakes not working.

I began to work on it.

Firstly, I cleaned the chassis with a microfiber cloth and WD-40. It was a pain to get all the old duct tape off, but it came out pretty well.

    <div class="col-12 col-lg-10 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/rustyChain.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Next, I replaced the chain, the back tire, and the inner tubes on both wheels.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-12 col-lg-10 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/backTire.jpeg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I’m very proud of the result:

    <div class="col-12 col-lg-10 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/finishedBike.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

This bike was my primary means of transportation for about a year—until I took it up an incline and, while shifting gears, the derailleur got caught in the back tire. I bent the metal back into shape, and it worked for a week or two before the screw holding the derailleur disappeared, making further repairs impractical.

RIP bike 2024–2025.

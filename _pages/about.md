I'm a junior at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning, with a strong interest in Robotics. I believe we're rapidly approaching a future of ubiquitous robotics, and now the critical challenge shifts from hardware—a largely solved problem, in my opinion, for current robotics use-cases—to software and integration.

I think robotics breakthroughs will mirror the effect computers and the internet had on productivity, except much more prevalently, ultimately empowering humanity to create and innovate at an unimaginable pace through human-robot collaboration.

This makes me very exited about developing robots that can intelligently interact with the world and actively work with humans.
